# Exercise 3: Deploy the solution to Azure Kubernetes Service

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will connect to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster created for you in this hands-on lab and deploy the Docker images to the cluster.

## Task 1: Tunnel into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will gather the information you need about your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to connect to the cluster and execute commands to connect to the Kubernetes management dashboard from the command shell.

> **Note**: The following tasks should be executed in a new command shell (cmd.exe or Git bash) on the lab VM, which we will designate as the Azure Command shell.

1. Login to Azure using the following command :

   ```bash
   az login
    
   ```

   - If you are not connected to the correct subscription, list your subscriptions and then set the subscription by its id with the following commands (similar to what you did in Command Shell before the lab):

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/ex3tsk1-step1.png?raw=true "kubectl get nodes")

1. Download kubectl and configure a search path to it. 

   ```bash
   az aks install-cli
   set PATH=%PATH%;%userprofile%\.azure-kubectl
   
   ```

1. Next, to enable kubectl to connect to the Kubernetes cluster, configure the required credentials after replace the [SUFFIX] values within the below command. Test that the configuration is correct by running a simple kubectl command to produce a list of nodes:

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -a --name fabmedical-[SUFFIX] --resource-group fabmedical-[SUFFIX]
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes

   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/ex3tsk1-step2.png?raw=true "kubectl get nodes")
   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](media/image75.png "kubectl get nodes")

## Task 2: Deploy a service using the Azure Portal

In this task, you will deploy the API application to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Azure Portal.

1. From the Azure Portal, select the resource group named fabmedical-DeploymentId, and then select your Kubernetes Service Azure resource.

   ![In this screenshot, the resource group was previously selected and the AKS cluster is selected.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/ex3tsk7-step1.png "Select fabmedical resource group")

2. We first need to define a Service for our API so that the application is accessible within the cluster. In the AKS blade select **Services and ingresses** and on the Services tab select **+ Add**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Service.](media/2021-03-25-17-04-04.png "Add a Service")

3. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and choose **Add**.

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
      name: api
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: api-traffic
          port: 3001
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 3001
      selector:
        app: api
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP
   ```

4. Now select **Workloads** under the **Kubernetes resources** section in the left navigation.

    ![Select workloads under Kubernetes resources.](media/2021-03-25-17-04-35.png "Select workloads under Kubernetes resources")

5. From the Workloads view, with **Deployments** selected (the default) then select **+ Add**.

   ![Selecting + Add to create a deployment.](media/2021-03-25-17-05-05.png "Selecing + Add to create a deployment")

6. In the **Add with YAML** screen that loads paste the following YAML and update the `[LOGINSERVER]` placeholder with the name of the ACR instance.

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
      name: api
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
      strategy:
        rollingUpdate:
        maxSurge: 1
        maxUnavailable: 1
        type: RollingUpdate
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: api
            name: api
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: api
              image: [LOGINSERVER].azurecr.io/content-api
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              livenessProbe:
                httpGet:
                  path: /
                  port: 3001
                initialDelaySeconds: 30
                periodSeconds: 20
                timeoutSeconds: 10
                failureThreshold: 3
              ports:
                - containerPort: 3001
                  hostPort: 3001
                  protocol: TCP
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: 1
                  memory: 128Mi
              securityContext:
                privileged: false
                terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
                terminationMessagePolicy: File
                dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
                restartPolicy: Always
                schedulerName: default-scheduler
                securityContext: {}
                terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
   ```

7. Select **Add** to initiate the deployment. This can take a few minutes after which you will see the deployment listed.

   ![Service is showing as unhealthy](media/2021-03-25-17-05-36.png "Service is showing as unhealthy")

8. Select the **api** deployment to open the Deployment, select **Live logs** and then a Pod from the drop-down. After a few moments, the live logs should appear.

   ![Service is showing as unhealthy](media/2021-03-25-17-06-09.png "Service is showing as unhealthy")

   > **Note:** if the logs don't display it may be the Pod no longer exists. You can use the **View in Log Analytics** to view historical logs regardless of Pod.

9. If you scroll through the log you can see it indicates that the content-api application is once again failing because it cannot find a MongoDB api to communicate with. You will resolve this issue by connecting to Cosmos DB.

   ![This screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard shows logs output for the api container.](media/2021-03-25-17-07-13.png "MongoDB communication error")

10. In the Azure Portal navigate to your resource group and find your Cosmos DB. Select the Cosmos DB resource to view details.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the Cosmos DB among existing resources.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/ex3tsk2-step7.png "Select CosmosDB resource from list")

11. Under **Quick Start** select the **Node.js** tab and copy the **Node.js 3.0 connection string**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the quick start for setting up Cosmos DB with MongoDB API. The copy button is highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/ex3tsk2-step8.png "Capture CosmosDB connection string")

12. Modify the copied connection string by adding the database `contentdb` to the URL, along with a replicaSet of `globaldb`. The resulting connection string should look like the below sample. Note that you may need to modify the endpoint URL.

    ```text
    mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@fabmedical-<SUFFIX>.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/contentdb?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb
    ```
    
    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Command Shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/connnectionstring.png?raw=true "Show encoded secret")

13. You will setup a Kubernetes secret to store the connection string and configure the `content-api` application to access the secret. First, you must base64 encode the secret value. Briefly use the previously used **bash window** and use the following command to encode the connection string and then, copy the output.

    > **Note**: Double quote marks surrounding the connection string are required to successfully produce the required output.

    ```bash
    echo -n "[CONNECTION STRING VALUE]" | base64 -w 0 - | echo $(</dev/stdin)
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Command Shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](media/hol-2019-10-18_07-12-13.png "Show encoded secret")

14. Return to the AKS blade in the Azure Portal and select **Configuration** under the **Kubernetes resources** section. Select **Secrets** and choose **+ Add**.

15. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and replace the placeholder with the encoded connection string from your clipboard and choose **Add**. Note that YAML is position sensitive so you must ensure indentation is correct when typing or pasting.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: cosmosdb
    type: Opaque
    data:
      db: <base64 encoded value>
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS howing the YAML file for creating a deployment.](media/2021-03-25-17-08-06.png "Upload YAML data")

16. Sort the Secrets list by name and you should now see your new secret displayed.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing secrets.](media/find-cosmosdb-secret.png "Manage Kubernetes secrets")

17. View the details for the **cosmosdb** secret by selected it in the list.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing the value of a secret.](media/2021-03-25-17-08-54.png "View cosmosdb secret")

18. Next, download the api deployment configuration using the following command in your Azure Command Shell window:

    ```bash
    kubectl get -o=yaml deployment api > api.deployment.yml
    ```

19. Edit the downloaded file using Visual Studio code editor:

    ```bash
    code api.deployment.yml
    ```

    Add the following environment configuration to the container spec, below the `image` property:

    ```yaml
      env:
      - name: MONGODB_CONNECTION
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: cosmosdb
            key: db
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing part of the deployment file.](media/Ex2-Task1.17.png "Edit the api.deployment.yml file")

20. Save your changes, minimise the editor and switch to the command shell window.

21. Update the api deployment by using `kubectl` to deploy the API.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete deployment api
    kubectl create -f api.deployment.yml
    ```

22. In the Azure Portal return to Live logs (see Step 5). The last log should show as connected to MongoDB.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing logs output.](media/2021-03-25-17-09-24.png "API Logs")

### Task 3: Deploy a service using kubectl

In this task, deploy the web service using `kubectl`.

1. Switch to the command Shell window.

1. Create a text file called `web.deployment.yml` using the Azure Command Shell
   Editor.

   ```bash
   code web.deployment.yml
   ```

1. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

   > **Note**: Be sure to copy and paste only the contents of the code block carefully to avoid introducing any special characters.
