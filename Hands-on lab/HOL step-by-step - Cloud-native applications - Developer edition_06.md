## Exercise 1: Migrate MongoDB to Cosmos DB using Azure Database Migration Service

**Duration**: 40 minutes

At this point, you have the web and API applications running in Docker instance (VM - Build Agent). The next, step is to migrate the MongoDB database data over to Azure Cosmos DB. This exercise will use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the data from the MongoDB database into Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Provision Azure Database Migration Service

In this task, you will deploy an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service that will be used to migrate the data from MongoDB to Cosmos DB.

1. From the Azure Portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

1. Search the marketplace for **Azure Database Migration Service** and select it.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Select **Continue to use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB database(s) to Azure SQL MI, Azure SQL DB, Azure DB for MySQL, Azure DB for PostgreSQL and Azure Cosmos DB** and click on **Select**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Migration Service** pane, enter the following values:

    - Resource group: Select **fabmedical-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group.
    - Migration service name:  Enter the name as **fabmedical<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**. You can get the DeploymentId from environment details tab
    - Location: **Choose the same Azure Region used for the Resource Group**.

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Migration Service Basics tab with all values entered.](media/dms-basic.png "Create Migration Basics Tab")

1. Select **Next: Networking >>**.

1. On the **Networking** tab, select the **Virtual Network** within the **fabmedical-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group.

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Migration Service Networking tab with Virtual Network selected.](media/dms-networking.png "Create Migration Service Networking tab")

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create** to create the Azure Database Migration Service instance.

The service may take 10 - 15 minutes to provision.

### Task 2: Migrate data to Azure Cosmos DB

In this task, you will create a **Migration project** within Azure Database Migration Service, and then migrate the data from MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your **fabmedical**(Build Agent) virtual machine in the resource group and copy the Private IP address **(2)** and Paste the private Ip address into the notepad for future use.

   ![Built Agent VM is shown. Overview tab is open. Private IP address is highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/media/agent-vm-private-ip-address.png?raw=true "Private IP Address")

2. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the **Azure Database Migration Service** that was previously provisioned.

3. On the Azure Database Migration Service blade, select **+ New Migration Project** on the **Overview** pane.

4. On the **New migration project** pane, enter the following values, then select **Create and run activity**:

    - Project name: `fabmedical`
    - Source server type: `MongoDB`
    - Target server type: `CosmosDB (MongoDB API)`
    - Choose type of activity: `Offline data migration`

    ![The screenshot shows the New migration project pane with values entered.](media/createandrunactivity.png  "New migration project pane")

    > **Note:** The **Offline data migration** activity type is selected since you will be performing a one-time migration from MongoDB to Cosmos DB. Also, the data in the database won't be updated during the migration. In a production scenario, you will want to choose the migration project activity type that best fits your solution requirements.

5. On the **MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB Offline Migration Wizard** pane, enter the following values for the **Select source** tab:

    - Mode: **Standard mode**
    - Source server name: Enter the Private IP Address of the Build Agent VM used in this lab.
    - Server port: `27017`
    - Require SSL: Unchecked

    > **Note:** Leave the **User Name** and **Password** blank as the MongoDB instance on the Build Agent VM for this lab does not have authentication turned on. The Azure Database Migration Service is connected to the same VNet as the Build Agent VM, so it's able to communicate within the VNet directly to the VM without exposing the MongoDB service to the Internet. In production scenarios, you should always have authentication enabled on MongoDB.

    ![Select source tab with values selected for the MongoDB server.](media/dmsselectsource.png "MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB - Select source")

6. Select **Next: Select target >>**.

7. On the **Select target** pane, select the following values:

    - Mode: **Select Cosmos DB target**

    - Subscription: Select the Azure subscription you're using for this lab.

    - Select Cosmos DB name: Select the **fabmedical-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** Cosmos DB instance.

    ![The Select target tab with values selected.](media/dmsselecttarget.png "MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB - Select target")

    Notice, the **Connection String** will automatically populate with the Key for your Azure Cosmos DB instance.

8. Select **Next: Database setting >>**.

9. On the **Database setting** tab, select the `contentdb` **Source Database** so this database from MongoDB will be migrated to Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The screenshot shows the Database setting tab with the contentdb source database selected.](media/dmsdatabasesetting.png "Database setting tab")

10. Select **Next: Collection setting >>**.

11. On the **Collection setting** tab, expand the **contentdb** database, and ensure both the **sessions** and **speakers** collections are selected for migration. Also, update the **Throughput (RU/s)** to `400` for both collections.

    ![The screenshot shows the Collection setting tab with both sessions and speakers collections selected with Throughput RU/s set to 400 for both collections.](media/dmscollectionsetting.png "Throughput RU")

12. Select **Next: Migration summary >>**.

13. On the **Migration summary** tab, enter `MigrateData` in the **Activity name** field, then select **Start migration** to initiate the migration of the MongoDB data to Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The screenshot shows the Migration summary is shown with MigrateData entered in the Activity name field.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/prod/Hands-on%20lab/media/dmsmigrationsummary.png?raw=true "Migration summary")

14. The status for the migration activity will be shown. The migration will only take a few seconds to complete. Select **Refresh** to reload the status to ensure it shows a **Status** of **Complete**.

    ![The screenshot shows the MigrateData activity showing the status has completed.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/prod/Hands-on%20lab/media/dmsmigratecomplete.png?raw=true "MigrateData activity completed")

15. To verify the data was migrated, navigate to the **Cosmos DB Account** for the lab within the Azure Portal, then select the **Data Explorer**. You will see the `speakers` and `sessions` collections listed within the `contentdb` database, and you will be able to explore the documents within.
